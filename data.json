    "bio": "I am a skilled developer with more than 6 years of experience creating, â€¨planning, and supporting Full stack projects. I enjoy tackling problems from the ground up, and the ideal place for me to do so is at a startup (2 -4 years). I'm curious about the processes and steps involved in working with a company, from the initial concept through raising funds, creating models, and so on."
